# movie-lookup-app
Search for and look up movies by title from TMDB

Run webservice with: npm start
  which will run on localhost:8000
  There seems to be an error where when running both webservice and webapp, the webservice page will appear in both localhost:3000 and localhost:8000
  The webservice is currently not working, so the application can be run with only the webapp

Run webapp with: npm run dev
  which will run on localhost:3000


One thing that could make this challenge a little better would be to put in some data processing with arrays. Like taking an average of the ratings, or sorting the movies in ascending or decending order based first on rating and then by title.
